# medMetric
A script to compute metrics for medical images based on some public libraries

I suppose you have installed: 
     Ubuntu 16.04
     simpleITK 
     numpy
     gcc 4.8+

if you want to test the functions, you can use <a href='https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py'>absltest</a> to write a simple test unit.

In this copy of codes, we have referred to https://github.com/Visceral-Project/EvaluateSegmentation and https://github.com/deepmind/surface-distance.
